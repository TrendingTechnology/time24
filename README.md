## About the project!

The purpose of this project is to simplify the documentation of working hours and at the same time to find ways to improve working hours. 

The working hours are saved in a JSON file and at a later date it can be read out as a JSON or PDF file.

This project has been built in [Dart](https://dart.dev/) using the [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) framework, which allows to build an app for mobile, desktop & web, from a single codebase.
